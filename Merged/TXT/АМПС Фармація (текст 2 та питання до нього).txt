1. PlagueNaturally acquired plague most commonly manifests in the bubonic form, with acute onset of fever and painful swollen regional lymph nodes (buboes). Less commonly, plague manifests in the septicemic form or as pneumonic plague, and, rarely, as meningeal, pharyngeal, ocular, or gastrointestinal plague. Abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, and malaise are characteristic in all cases.Occasionally, patients have symptoms of mild lymphadenitis or prominent gastrointestinal tract symptoms, which may obscure the correct diagnosis.When left untreated, plague will often progress to overwhelming sepsis with renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, instability, diffuse intravascular coagulation, necrosis of distal extremities, and death.Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis, a pleomorphic, bipolar-staining, gram-negative coccobacillus.Plague is a zoonotic infection primarily maintained in rodents and their fleas. Humans are incidental hosts who typically develop bubonic or primary septicemic manifestations through the bite of infected rodent fleas or direct contact with tissues of infected animals. Secondary pneumonic plague arises from hematogenous seeding of the lungs with Y pestis in patients with untreated bubonic or septicemic plague. Primary pneumonic plague is acquired by inhalation of respiratory tract droplets from a human or animal with pneumonic plague. Only the pneumonic form has been shown to be transmitted from person to person, and the last known case of person-to-person transmission in the United States occurred in 1924. Rarely, humans can develop primary pneumonic plague following exposure to domestic cats with respiratory tract plague infections. Plague occurs worldwide with enzootic foci in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Most human plague cases are reported from rural, underdeveloped areas and mainly occur as isolated cases or in small, focal clusters. Since 2000, more than 95% of the approximately 22,000 cases reported to the World Health Organization have been from countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
